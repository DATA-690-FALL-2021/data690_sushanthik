- With the hel of this tool, we can perform join operation between two data sets by just dragging the "Data Join" module that is present under "Data Processing" tools.
- The result of the join will be the concatinated file that contains the data of both the given files.
- This tool also provides the flexibility to modify the record values and the varibales. This help us to modify the data set at any required point of time based on our usage.
